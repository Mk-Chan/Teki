# Teki
A free, UCI protocol chess engine programmed in C++.

This is an engine built to be simple, UCI-compliant and
intentionally weak for the purpose of Human vs Machine play for
average players. The strength will be designed to hit a hard upper
limit of about 2200 with level support for weaker play.
